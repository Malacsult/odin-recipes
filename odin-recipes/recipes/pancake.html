    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour - 200 g</li>
        <li>Eggs - 2 pcs</li>
        <li>Milk - 0,3 l</li>
        <li>Sparkling Water - 0,2 l</li>
        <li>Salt</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the flour, eggs, milk, sparkling water and salt to a bowl and mix thoroughly</li>
        <li>Once mixed, slowly add the oil in a continous thin stream while mixing</li>
        <li>If the pancake mix is too thick, add some milk. If it is too runny, add some flour</li>
        <li>Preheat non-stick pan, and add a tiny drop of oil. You only need oil for the first pancake! (Because there is oil in the mixture)</li>
        <li>When the first side hardens, flip to other side</li>
        <li>When the other side hardens, you're done :)</li>
    </ol>
